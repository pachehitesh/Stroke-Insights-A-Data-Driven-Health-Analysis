# Stroke Insights: A Data-Driven Health Analysis

This project aims to analyze a stroke dataset to uncover meaningful insights about the factors that contribute to stroke occurrences. It uses **Python** for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboarding.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To explore and analyze stroke-related health data, identify patterns and potential risk factors, and visualize the findings in a clear and interactive way.

## 📁 Contents

- `Stroke.csv`: Dataset used for analysis
- `Python & Power BI Hackathon.ipynb`: Main notebook for data analysis and visualization
- Power BI Dashboard (optional): Visual report for stakeholders

---

## 📊 Key Techniques Used

- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Missing value imputation
- Statistical analysis of health indicators
- Power BI for interactive dashboards (if included)

---

## 📌 Results Summary

- Identified key health indicators linked to stroke (e.g., hypertension, BMI, age)
- Cleaned and prepared data for ML or BI tools
- Created visual summaries using Python and Power BI
